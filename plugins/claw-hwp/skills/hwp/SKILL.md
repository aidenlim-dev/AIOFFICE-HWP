# HWP / HWPX Skill

This skill helps Claude work with Korean Hangul Word Processor documents — reading, creating, and editing both the binary `.hwp` (HWP 5.0) and the ZIP-based `.hwpx` formats.

## 🎯 Filling in an existing form (READ THIS FIRST)

By a wide margin the most common task on this skill is **"fill in this Hangul form for me"** — the user hands you an existing `.hwp` (often empty-looking) and asks to add a row, complete a field, or update a number. This section is the *only* correct flow for that task. Every other branch below is for less common cases.

**Trigger phrases (Korean / English):**

> 양식 채워줘 · 양식 작성해줘 · 이 표에 N 채워줘 · 보고서 양식에 X 추가해줘 ·
> "fill in this form" · "add to this report" · "complete this template" ·
> "이번 주 일정 채워줘" · "셀에 Y 넣어줘"

**Heuristic for recognising a form (do this before deciding the flow):**

- Filename contains: `양식`, `template`, `보고서`, `계약서`, `공문`, `신청서`, `계획서`, or `_form` / `_template`
- `extract_text.js` returns mostly empty lines (or just headings), but the file is not zero-bytes
- `extract_text.js --inspect` reports `tableCount >= 1`

If ANY of these hits, treat the file as a form. Skip the rest of the decision tree and follow steps 1–3 below.

**Steps:**

0. **Decide where the result goes — and ASK if the user's wording is ambiguous.**

   This is the single most common place where this skill goes wrong: the agent decides on the user's behalf that "원본을 보존하는 게 안전하니까 새 파일을 만들자" out of friendliness, and ends up writing a fresh blank document at `<orig>_updated.hwp` / `<orig>_filled.hwp` / `<orig>_v2.hwp` with none of the form's layout. The user wanted their form filled in, not a sidecar.

   Read the user's wording carefully:

   | User said | Where the result goes | How to do it |
   |-----------|----------------------|--------------|
   | "이 파일 **고쳐줘** / **채워줘** / **추가해줘** / **수정해줘**", "여기에 적어줘", "fill in this form", "complete the template" | **In-place on the same file.** This is the default. | Steps 1–3 below on the original path. |
   | "**사본** 만들어줘", "**복사본**에 추가", "새 파일로 저장", "**다른 이름**으로", "copy and fill in", "save as a new file" | **New path** in the same directory, explicit. | `cp <orig.hwp> <new.hwp>` FIRST, then run steps 1–3 on `<new.hwp>`. The cp preserves the form's layout/tables/fonts — never reach for `create.js` with `setup_document` to "make the copy from scratch". |
   | User just sent the form and said "도와줘" / "처리해줘" / "이거 좀" / "help me with this" / etc. — no explicit verb about where to put the result | **ASK before doing anything.** One short sentence: "원본 `<filename>` 을 직접 수정할까요, 아니면 사본을 만들까요?" Wait for the answer; do not guess. | — |

   Default to in-place. The user still has Time Machine / git / Finder undo if they want to revert. Creating sidecar files clutters the user's Downloads folder and obscures which file is the "real" one — they almost never want that unless they say so.

   **A "copy" means a byte-for-byte file copy (`cp`), not a regenerated document.** This is the next failure mode after the in-place vs new-path decision: the agent picks "new path" correctly, then reaches for `create.js {setup_document, append_*}` to "build the copy". That isn't a copy — it's a brand-new blank document with a sidecar filename, which loses the form's tables, fonts, header art, and page numbering exactly as if it had overwritten the original. The 1.4.2 code guard on `setup_document` only blocks overwriting the *same* path, not a new path; sidecar regeneration slips past the guard. The only correct way to make a copy of a form is `cp <orig> <new>` (a real filesystem copy) and then edit the copy with `set_cell_text*`.

1. **Probe the form's tables (rhwp inspect) — do NOT extract_text or hwpx-convert for analysis.**
   `extract_text.js` cannot read text inside `<hp:tbl>` cells (rhwp returns the body paragraph only). An "empty" extract_text result on a form does NOT mean the form is empty — it means the cells are unreadable through that API. Likewise `convert.js` drops tables entirely on hwp→hwpx, so converting to inspect the structure destroys the very thing you need to inspect.

   Use the rhwp probe in Path B step 2 instead. It tells you `(section, paragraph, control, row, col)` for every cell in every table.

2. **Edit with `set_cell_text` or `set_cell_text_by_label` ONLY.**
   These ops route through the raw-patch path (see "Hancom Docs compatibility" below) and preserve the form's layout, fonts, header art, signature blocks, and page numbering exactly. The user gets a file they can open in Hancom Docs (cloud) and share.

   Do NOT mix in `append_paragraph` / `append_heading` / `append_table` / `replace_text` etc. Mixed payloads silently fall back to the rhwp emit path, which produces files Hancom Docs cloud refuses to open. If the user really needs both kinds of edits, run two separate `create.js` calls and tell them the second output is Hancom-Office-Desktop-only.

3. **Verify the response shows `"mode": "raw-patch"`** in the JSON output. Then `preview_start` / `preview_eval` to show the result. If the user is going to share via Hancom Docs, the raw-patch mode is required.

**Things to NEVER do when filling in a form** (these are the recurring failure modes — every one of these has burned this skill in a past session):

- ❌ `node convert.js form.hwp form.hwpx` to "analyse the structure" — drops every table, you'll never find the cells.
- ❌ Conclude "the form is empty" from `extract_text.js` output. Form cells are systematically invisible to that tool. (As of 1.4.2, `extract_text.js --inspect` reports the *real* `tableCount` for `.hwp` inputs by talking to rhwp directly, so `tableCount >= 1` is now a reliable form signal.)
- ❌ Read `convert.js` output XML and try to plan edits from there — the XML is missing the tables.
- ❌ `create.js` with `setup_document` as the first op on a path that already exists. As of 1.4.2 this is **enforced in code** — `create.js` rejects such payloads with a clear error that points back to `set_cell_text*`. It proceeds only if the caller adds `"allow_overwrite": true` at the top level of the payload, which is an explicit "yes, destroy the existing file" opt-in. Use that escape hatch only when the user really asked for a brand-new file at that path, never as a workaround when `set_cell_text*` looks complicated.
- ❌ Edit a copy named `*_filled.hwp` / `*_v2.hwp` from scratch — the user wanted in-place edits, not a new file with the same content shape.
- ❌ Decide on the user's behalf that "원본 보존이 안전하니까 새 파일을 만든다" when the prompt language (`추가해줘`, `채워줘`, `수정해줘`, `여기에 적어줘`) clearly meant in-place. Friendliness reflex that creates `<orig>_updated.hwp` is the exact failure mode that has shipped broken sidecar files to users for three releases running. If the user's wording is unambiguous, just edit in-place; if it's ambiguous, ASK (step 0).
- ❌ Build "the copy" with `create.js` + `setup_document` even when the user explicitly asked for a copy. A copy of a form means a `cp <orig> <new>` filesystem copy, period. Generating a fresh blank document at a sidecar path is NOT a copy — it's a brand-new file that happens to share a similar name, with none of the original form's tables / layout / signatures. The 1.4.2 guard does not catch this because the output path is different from the input. Read step 0's "How to do it" column: `cp` first, then edit the copy with `set_cell_text*`.

## Hancom Docs compatibility

`set_cell_text` / `set_cell_text_by_label` on an existing `.hwp` use a **raw-patch** path that never calls `rhwp.exportHwp()`. The output keeps the original CFB layout (no `Sh33tJ5` fingerprint, original directory order) and **opens in Hancom Docs cloud**.

The raw-patch path is taken automatically when **every op in the payload is `set_cell_text*` and the file already exists**. Mixed payloads (e.g. `set_cell_text` + `append_paragraph`) silently fall back to the regular rhwp emit path — those outputs open in Hancom Office Desktop but Hancom Docs will reject them. The `create.js` response shows `"mode": "raw-patch"` when the new path runs, so you can tell at a glance.

If you need a Hancom-Docs-compatible result, split the work: one call that only edits cells, separate calls for other op types (paragraph append, etc.).

## ⚠️ Hard rules

> **Default to in-place editing when the user asks to fill in / add to / modify an EXISTING `.hwp` or `.hwpx` form.** `create.js` from scratch destroys the form's layout, fonts, header art, signature blocks, and page numbering — which is almost never what the user wanted when they sent you a template. Reach for `set_cell_text*` (see Path B) first.
>
> **`replace_text` reporting 0 matches is NOT a "can't edit" signal — it's a "the anchor is inside a table" signal.** rhwp's `searchText` does not enter `<hp:tbl>`. The correct next step is `set_cell_text_by_label`, not regeneration. See Path B.
>
> **Do NOT use `convert.js` (.hwp → .hwpx) for *analysis*.** The conversion drops every table — by the time you `unpack.py` the result, the form's cells you wanted to inspect are gone. Convert.js is only for *delivering* output to a user who explicitly asked for `.hwpx`, and only when the document is text-heavy with no critical tables.
>
> **Before declaring a limitation, run the coordinate probe in Path B step 2.** If `getCellInfo` returns any table, you can edit those cells. The "HWPX tables are dropped by `exportHwpx()`" warning listed later applies to *conversion* and *new-document emission*, not to in-place edits.
>
> **When regeneration IS the right answer**: only after the probe shows the target content is NOT inside an `<hp:tbl>` (e.g. it lives inside an `<hp:rect>` or other shape that this skill's ops can't reach), AND the user has been told that regenerating will lose the original layout, OR the user explicitly asks for a fresh document. State the trade-off plainly first — don't silently swap "fill in" for "create new".

## Quick reference

| Task | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Read text content (body paragraphs only — **misses table cells**, see ⚠️ below) | `node scripts/extract_text.js <file>` |
| Read as markdown (preserves headings/tables) | `node scripts/extract_text.js --format markdown <file>` |
| Inspect structure (pages, sections, tables) | `node scripts/extract_text.js --inspect <file>` |
| **Fill in an existing form (cells)** | `set_cell_text` / `set_cell_text_by_label` op via `create.js` — see "🎯 Filling in an existing form" above |
| Create new document from scratch | `echo '{"path":"out.hwp","operations":[...]}' \| node scripts/create.js` |
| Edit existing `.hwpx` body text (paragraphs, not table cells) | unpack → edit XML directly with `Edit` tool → pack |
| Edit existing `.hwp` body text (paragraphs, not table cells) | `replace_text` op via `create.js` |
| Convert `.hwp` ↔ `.hwpx` (delivery only, drops tables — never use for analysis) | `node scripts/convert.js <input> <output>` |
| Validate output | `python scripts/validate.py <file.hwpx>` |
| Preview file (Desktop = inline pane, CLI = browser link, cowork = drop-in viewer URL) | See Preview section for the surface decision rule |

> Conversion to PDF / DOCX is **out of scope for v0**. Will be added in a later release via LibreOffice headless.

## Format primer

- **`.hwpx`** — ZIP container holding XML. Same archetype as `.docx`. Use the unpack/edit/pack workflow. Internal layout includes `Contents/section0.xml` (body), `Contents/header.xml` (styles, fonts), `Contents/content.hpf` (manifest). See `references/hwpx-format.md`.
- **`.hwp`** — HWP 5.0 binary (CFB/OLE container). NOT a ZIP. Direct XML editing is impossible. For edits, convert to `.hwpx` via `convert.js`. For read-only operations, `extract_text.js` handles binary `.hwp` transparently via the rhwp WASM library.

When in doubt about format, read the first two bytes — `PK` indicates ZIP (treat as HWPX even if extension is `.hwp`).

## Decision tree

### "Read this file" / "Summarize" / "Translate the content"

> **Empty `extract_text.js` output does NOT mean the document is empty.** rhwp's text extractor reads body paragraphs but NOT text inside `<hp:tbl>` cells. A government form, a meeting-minute template, or a budget sheet will routinely look "empty" through `extract_text.js` because all the user-visible content lives in tables. If the input is a form and `extract_text.js` is empty, go to "🎯 Filling in an existing form" above — that's the case this skill handles best.

```bash
node scripts/extract_text.js path/to/file.hwp > /tmp/text.txt
# Then read /tmp/text.txt and respond
```

`extract_text.js` handles both `.hwp` and `.hwpx` via rhwp WASM. Default output is plaintext (one paragraph per line).

For structured content (headings, tables, lists preserved):
```bash
node scripts/extract_text.js --format markdown path/to/file.hwp > /tmp/text.md
```

For metadata only:
```bash
node scripts/extract_text.js --inspect path/to/file.hwp
# Returns JSON: { pageCount, sectionCount, paragraphCount, tableCount, hasImages, ... }
```

### "Create a new document" / "Write this as a hwp file"

`create.js` reads a JSON payload from stdin and writes the file to the path you supply. Output format is decided by the path extension (`.hwp` = HWP 5.0 binary, `.hwpx` = OOXML).

```bash
echo '{
  "path": "report.hwp",
  "operations": [
    {"type": "setup_document", "page_size": "a4", "margin_mm": 25},
    {"type": "append_heading", "level": 1, "text": "월간 보고서"},
    {"type": "append_paragraph", "text": "이번 달 핵심 지표 요약입니다. 주요 변화는 **매출 증가**와 *비용 절감*입니다."},
    {"type": "append_table",
      "headers": ["항목", "지난달", "이번달"],
      "rows": [["매출", "100억", "120억"], ["비용", "80억", "75억"]]
    },
    {"type": "append_image", "path": "/abs/path/chart.png", "width_cm": 12, "height_cm": 6.6}
  ]
}' | node scripts/create.js
```

`stdout` returns one JSON line:

```json
{ "status": "success", "path": "report.hwp", "bytes_written": 14336, "ops_applied": 5,
  "verify": { "pageCountAfter": 1, "recovered": true },
  "log": ["…", "stripped 4 PARA_LINESEG record(s)"] }
```

Errors come back as `{"status": "error", "message": "...", "op_index": N}`. Always read the JSON to confirm — exit code 0 even on op-level failures isn't guaranteed.

**Op vocabulary** (grouped by purpose):

*Creation / appending content (used while building a doc top-down):*

| Op | Required | Optional |
|----|----------|----------|
| `setup_document` | `page_size` (`a4`/`b5`/...), `orientation` (`portrait`/`landscape`) | `margin_mm`, `base_font` |
| `append_heading` | `level` (1–6), `text` | `align`, `runs` |
| `append_paragraph` | `text` | `align`, `line_spacing`, `spacing_before`, `spacing_after`, `runs` |
| `append_table` | `headers`, `rows` | `col_widths_cm`, `merges`, `cell_props` |
| `append_image` | `path` | `width_cm`, `height_cm`, `alt` |
| `append_bullet_list`, `append_numbered_list` | `items[]` | — |
| `append_page_break` | — | — |

*In-place editing (run on an existing file — omit `setup_document` so create.js loads the path instead of starting blank):*

| Op | Required | Optional | Notes |
|----|----------|----------|-------|
| `replace_text` | `query`, `replacement` | `case_sensitive` | **Body text only.** rhwp's `searchText` does NOT walk into table cells, so anchor text inside `<hp:tbl>` is invisible — use `set_cell_text*` instead. |
| `set_cell_text` | `section`, `para`, `control`, (`row`+`col`) or `cell`, `text` | `cell_para` | Replaces one cell's text. `row`+`col` is recommended; `cell` is the flat row-major index. |
| `set_cell_text_by_label` | `label`, `text` | `row_offset`, `col_offset`, `occurrence`, `case_sensitive`, `cell_para`, `section`+`para`+`control` (to scope to one table) | Find a cell whose text contains `label`, then write to the cell at `(label_row + row_offset, label_col + col_offset)`. Doc-wide sweep by default. |

Inline `**bold**` and `*italic*` are parsed automatically inside `text` and table cell strings. `runs:[{text, bold?, italic?, fontSize?, color?}]` overrides the parser when you need finer control.

**Known limitations** (rhwp serializer constraints — these apply to *creation* and *format conversion*. They do NOT apply to in-place editing of an existing `.hwp` file: see Path B in the Edit section, which preserves tables completely):

- **HWPX tables are dropped when re-emitting via `exportHwpx()`** — i.e. when converting `.hwp` → `.hwpx` or saving a fresh document as `.hwpx`. If a doc has tables, save as `.hwp`. This does **not** affect editing an existing `.hwp` in place; in-place edits via `set_cell_text*` preserve tables.
- **HWP→HWPX downconversion is lossy** (tables, images, complex shapes). Default to `.hwp` for tables; default to `.hwpx` only when the document is text-heavy. Again, this is a *conversion* constraint, not an *edit* constraint.
- **`replace_text` doesn't see table cells.** See the op table above and the discussion in Path B. The correct response to 0 matches is to switch to `set_cell_text_by_label`, not to regenerate the document.
- **Hancom Docs (cloud) only accepts the raw-patch path** — see the Hancom Docs compatibility section near the top. Anything that goes through `rhwp.exportHwp()` (new document creation, mixed payloads, `convert.js` output) opens in Hancom Office Desktop but is rejected by Hancom Docs with "문서를 열 수 없습니다." If the user will share via Hancom Docs, restrict the payload to `set_cell_text*` only.

### "Edit this document" / "Replace X with Y" / "Add a new paragraph"

There are **two editing paths** with different capabilities. Pick by checking the input file extension AND whether the edit touches a table.

#### Decision rule

| Input | Edit touches a table cell? | Use |
|-------|----------------------------|-----|
| `.hwpx` | yes or no | **Path A** — unpack + XML edit + pack |
| `.hwp` | no (body text / paragraph only) | **Path A** — convert to `.hwpx` first, then unpack/edit/pack. Save back to `.hwp` only if required. |
| `.hwp` | **yes** | **Path B** — wasm op vocab on the original `.hwp`. Do NOT convert: rhwp's hwp→hwpx step drops tables. |

Detect format by reading the first two bytes — `PK` = HWPX (treat as `.hwpx` regardless of extension).

#### Path A — `.hwpx` XML edit (preferred for non-table edits)

Same archetype as `.docx`. Unpack → edit XML directly with the `Edit` tool → pack.

1. Unpack:
   ```bash
   python scripts/unpack.py path/to/file.hwpx /tmp/unpacked/
   ```
2. Edit files in `/tmp/unpacked/Contents/`:
   - `section0.xml` (plus `section1.xml`, ...) — body content
   - `header.xml` — document-level styles, fonts, page settings
   - `content.hpf` — manifest

   Common patterns:

   ```xml
   <!-- Body paragraph -->
   <hp:p id="..."><hp:run charPrIDRef="..."><hp:t>본문 텍스트</hp:t></hp:run>
     <hp:linesegarray>
       <hp:lineseg textpos="0" .../>
     </hp:linesegarray>
   </hp:p>

   <!-- Table cell -->
   <hp:tbl rowCnt="3" colCnt="2" ...>
     <hp:tr>
       <hp:tc rowSpan="1" colSpan="1">
         <hp:subList>
           <hp:p><hp:run charPrIDRef="..."><hp:t>100만원</hp:t></hp:run>
             <hp:linesegarray><hp:lineseg textpos="0" .../></hp:linesegarray>
           </hp:p>
         </hp:subList>
       </hp:tc>
     </hp:tr>
   </hp:tbl>
   ```

   **Lineseg cache invalidation.** `<hp:linesegarray>` is a precomputed line-break cache. If you change a `<hp:t>` text, the cache becomes stale and non-Hancom readers will draw text at wrong positions. Two ways to fix:
   - **Delete the `<hp:linesegarray>` block** on edited paragraphs. Hancom recalculates on open; the preview viewer's "자동 보정 ON" (default) does the same via `reflowLinesegs()`.
   - **Or** leave the cache and accept that the inline preview may show slight offsets until 자동 보정 is toggled.

3. Repack:
   ```bash
   python scripts/pack.py /tmp/unpacked/ output.hwpx --original path/to/file.hwpx
   ```
4. Validate:
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate.py output.hwpx
   ```

**When the input is `.hwp` but the edit doesn't touch tables**: convert first, then proceed.
```bash
node scripts/convert.js input.hwp /tmp/converted.hwpx
# Then unpack /tmp/converted.hwpx as above.
# To save back to .hwp afterwards:
node scripts/convert.js output.hwpx final.hwp
```

#### Path B — `.hwp` wasm ops (only path for in-place table-cell edits)

When the input is `.hwp` and a table cell needs to change, the hwpx round-trip drops the whole table — wasm op vocab is the only safe route. The flow is the same as create.js's normal flow, just on an existing file:

1. Write a JSON op script and pipe it into `create.js`. Because the path already exists and the first op is NOT `setup_document`, create.js loads the existing file:
   ```bash
   echo '{
     "path": "/Users/me/budget.hwp",
     "operations": [
       {"type": "set_cell_text_by_label",
        "label": "1차년도 현금", "col_offset": 1, "text": "100만원"},
       {"type": "set_cell_text",
        "section": 0, "para": 1, "control": 0, "row": 2, "col": 1, "text": "50만원"}
     ]
   }' | node scripts/create.js
   ```

2. **Coordinate discovery** — when you don't already know `section / para / control / row / col`, do NOT guess and do NOT give up. Run this probe via `node -e` or a temp `.mjs` and read the output:

   ```javascript
   // Save as /tmp/probe.mjs, run: node /tmp/probe.mjs <path-to.hwp>
   import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
   const DIR = '<absolute path to plugin>/skills/hwp/scripts'; // see Bundled scripts below
   globalThis.measureTextWidth = (f, t) => t.length * (parseFloat(f) || 10) * 0.55;
   const rhwp = await import(`${DIR}/vendor/rhwp/rhwp.js`);
   await rhwp.default({ module_or_path: readFileSync(`${DIR}/vendor/rhwp/rhwp_bg.wasm`) });
   const doc = new rhwp.HwpDocument(new Uint8Array(readFileSync(process.argv[2])));
   for (let sec = 0; sec < doc.getSectionCount(); sec++) {
     for (let p = 0, P = doc.getParagraphCount(sec); p < P; p++) {
       for (let c = 0; c < 64; c++) { // critical: scan all 64 indices per paragraph
         let info; try { info = JSON.parse(doc.getCellInfo(sec, p, c, 0)); } catch { continue; }
         if (!info || typeof info.row !== 'number') continue;
         // It's a table. Walk every cell and print the first non-empty text per row.
         let rows = 0, cols = 0;
         const cells = [];
         for (let i = 0; i < 2000; i++) {
           let ci; try { ci = JSON.parse(doc.getCellInfo(sec, p, c, i)); } catch { break; }
           if (!ci || typeof ci.row !== 'number') break;
           let t = ''; try { t = doc.getTextInCell(sec, p, c, i, 0, 0, 80); } catch {}
           cells.push({ i, r: ci.row, col: ci.col, t: t.replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim() });
           rows = Math.max(rows, ci.row + 1); cols = Math.max(cols, ci.col + 1);
         }
         console.log(`sec=${sec} para=${p} ctrl=${c} (${rows}×${cols})`);
         for (const x of cells) if (x.t) console.log(`  [${x.i}] r=${x.r} c=${x.col} "${x.t}"`);
       }
     }
   }
   doc.free();
   ```

   **Why ALL 64 controls per paragraph**: government and corporate forms commonly stack a logo at `ctrl=0`, a checkbox at `ctrl=1`, a textbox at `ctrl=2`, and only THEN the actual cover table at `ctrl=3`. Breaking on the first non-table index silently hides every table behind it. Always scan up to `MAX_CONTROL_IDX = 64`.

   The probe output gives you `sec=X para=Y ctrl=Z` for every table and the labeled cells inside. Pick the table you need, find the row whose anchor matches the user's mention, then write either `set_cell_text` (you have exact `row`+`col`) or `set_cell_text_by_label` with `section`/`para`/`control` scope.

3. **`replace_text` silently misses table cells. This is the most common source of false "can't edit" judgments.** rhwp's `searchText` (and therefore `replaceOne`) does not enter `<hp:tbl>`. If `replace_text` reports 0 matches on what looks like a present anchor, it does NOT mean the document is uneditable. It means the anchor lives in a table cell. **Run the probe above and switch to `set_cell_text_by_label`** — don't fall back to creating a new file.

4. **Auto-preview after writes.** Per the trigger guidance below, fire `preview_start` / `preview_eval` immediately after the write so the user sees the edit, instead of asking them to verify.

**Output format default**: save edits as `.hwpx`. The HWPX format is the modern Hangul Office standard and avoids the lossy round-trip back to HWP 5.0 binary. Only convert back to `.hwp` if the user explicitly requires HWP 5.0 output (use `node scripts/convert.js output.hwpx final.hwp` and warn that some formatting may be lost).

### "Show me what this looks like" / "Preview this HWP file"

The skill ships a tiny Node HTTP server (`scripts/preview-server.js`) that serves a vanilla-JS canvas-based viewer; rhwp WASM does the actual rendering in the browser, so the result matches Hancom Office closely. No LibreOffice, no external browser plugin.

**The preview path depends on which Claude surface you're running in.** The decision rule, applied first thing every time the user wants to view a file:

| Surface | Detection | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code Desktop** (Code mode in the desktop app) | `preview_start` / `preview_eval` / `preview_stop` tools are present | Use the host-managed inline pane. See "Inline pane path" below. |
| **Claude Code CLI** (and any other surface where Bash runs on the user's machine but no `preview_*` tools exist) | `uname -s` returns `Darwin` / `Linux` / `MINGW*` *and* no `preview_*` tools | Self-host: bash launches `preview-server.js`, then hand the user a markdown link. See "Self-host link path" below. |
| **Cowork** (claude.ai web cowork, Claude Desktop's cowork mode) | No `preview_*` tools, and you're inside a remote Linux sandbox (Bash can't reach the user's `localhost`) | Emit the file plus a one-line link to the hosted browser viewer; user downloads the file and drops it onto the viewer page. The OS-launcher block is the offline fallback. See "Cowork drop-in viewer path" below. Do not run `preview-server.js` inside the sandbox — its `localhost` is unreachable from the user's browser. |
| **Claude API direct** (developer's app embedding the SDK) | Depends on developer's deployment | If their Bash is on the user's machine, treat as CLI. If it's on a remote server, treat as cowork. |

#### Inline pane path (Claude Code Desktop only)

This is the only surface that exposes `preview_start` / `preview_eval` / `preview_stop`. Setup once per workspace via `.claude/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "claw-hwp-preview",
      "runtimeExecutable": "node",
      "runtimeArgs": ["${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/hwp/scripts/preview-server.js"],
      "port": 3737
    }
  ]
}
```

If missing, create or merge before calling `preview_start`. Code substitutes `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` at load time. (When typing the path manually for debugging, an installed plugin lives at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/`.) Port `3737` is the default; override via `CLAW_HWP_PREVIEW_PORT`.

Lifecycle — the viewer is a long-lived page in a long-lived pane. You do NOT spawn a fresh server per file.

1. **`preview_start`** with `name: "claw-hwp-preview"`. Returns either a fresh pane or `reused: true` if one is already open.
2. **`preview_eval`** to set `window.location.href = "http://localhost:3737/?path=<absolute path>"`. Use this both for the first navigation and for swapping files. Do not start a second server.
3. **`preview_stop`** when you need to recover a stuck pane (below).

Stuck pane recovery — when `preview_start` returns `reused: true` but nothing is visible (the prior pane was closed/hidden), hard-reset: `preview_stop` → `preview_start` → `preview_eval`. Don't ask the user, just do it.

Pair with hosted-viewer link — after the inline pane is up, append a single auxiliary line so the user has a one-click escape to a full browser window (bigger view, side-by-side compare, easy sharing). The pane stays the primary path; this just gives them options:

```
큰 화면이나 공유가 필요하면 [브라우저에서 열기](https://dohyun468.github.io/claw-hwp/) — 파일을 끌어 놓으세요.
```

Don't repeat the link on every preview swap inside the same conversation — once per session is enough.

#### Self-host link path (Claude Code CLI, local-bash API setups)

No host-managed pane available, but Bash can reach the user's localhost. Health-check first; if dead, start it yourself — never ask the user to run anything.

```bash
SCRIPT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}/skills/hwp/scripts/preview-server.js"
[ -f "$SCRIPT" ] || SCRIPT=$(find "$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/claw-hwp" \
  -path '*/skills/hwp/scripts/preview-server.js' 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)
curl -fsS -o /dev/null http://localhost:3737/__heartbeat || \
  node "$SCRIPT" >/tmp/claw-hwp-preview.log 2>&1 &
disown 2>/dev/null || true
sleep 0.5
```

Then emit a markdown link the user clicks to open in their default browser:

```
[열기 — <filename>](http://localhost:3737/?path=<absolute path>)
```

`preview-server.js` self-exits ~2 minutes after the last viewer tab closes (heartbeat-based), so on a return visit you may need to repeat the health-check + relaunch. The script handles that — just always run the snippet above before emitting a link.

#### Cowork drop-in viewer path (cowork = remote sandbox, no local Bash)

The sandbox's `localhost:3737` is unreachable from the user's browser, so we can't open the viewer from the agent side. Instead, the same viewer is hosted as a **static page on GitHub Pages**: the user opens the URL once in their browser and then drag-drops (or file-picks) the `.hwp`/`.hwpx` to render it locally in-tab. No download, no install, no Node required — rhwp WASM runs directly in the browser.

After writing the HWP file, append this block to your reply:

```
**미리보기:** 위 파일을 받아서 아래 페이지에 끌어 놓으면 바로 열려요:
<https://dohyun468.github.io/claw-hwp/>

(Drag-drop 또는 우측 상단 폴더 아이콘으로 파일 선택. 파일은 브라우저 안에서만 열리고 서버에 업로드되지 않습니다.)
```

Fallback — if the user is offline or the GitHub Pages URL is unreachable, the OS launcher path still works. It runs the same viewer locally via `preview-server.js`. Only emit this if the user reports the URL doesn't work:

```
**오프라인 미리보기 (대안):** OS 별 launcher 받아서 위 파일과 같은 폴더에 두고 더블클릭. Node.js 18+ 필요.

- macOS: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoHyun468/claw-hwp/main/plugins/claw-hwp/skills/hwp/scripts/launcher/preview-mac.command>
- Windows: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoHyun468/claw-hwp/main/plugins/claw-hwp/skills/hwp/scripts/launcher/preview-windows.bat>
- Linux: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoHyun468/claw-hwp/main/plugins/claw-hwp/skills/hwp/scripts/launcher/preview-linux.sh>
```

What the launcher does on the user's machine (kept for the fallback path):
1. Looks for `preview-server.js` in the local Claude plugin cache (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/claw-hwp/...`). If found, uses it.
2. Otherwise downloads `scripts/` from the GitHub `main` tarball into `~/.claw-hwp-launcher/` (~5 MB, one-time).
3. Boots `preview-server.js` on `localhost:3737` if not already up (idempotent — health-checks first).
4. Opens the user's default browser at `http://localhost:3737/?path=<absolute path of the .hwp/.hwpx>`.

Auto-detection: if no file argument is passed, the launcher picks the most recent `.hwp`/`.hwpx` in its own directory. Server lifetime: `preview-server.js` self-exits ~2 minutes after the last viewer tab closes.

#### When to fire preview (all paths)

Don't ask, just do it. Visual verification is your job.

1. Right after `create.js` / `convert.js` writes a new file or finishes a format conversion.
2. Right after the user uploads a `.hwp` / `.hwpx` or mentions one by path.
3. Right after edits (`replace_text`, unpack-edit-pack round-trip).

In Desktop and CLI paths, "fire preview" means open the viewer / link directly. In cowork, "fire preview" means emit the hosted-viewer URL block alongside the file (launcher block only if asked or offline). Never write "please check if the file looks right" — give the user a working preview path.

## Common pitfalls

- **Don't silently regenerate an existing form just because `replace_text` returned 0 matches.** The most common failure mode of this skill: `replace_text` returns 0 → Claude concludes "table editing is unsupported" → calls `create.js` with `setup_document`, destroying the form's layout, header, fonts, signature blocks, and page numbering. The correct first response to 0 matches is the Path B coordinate probe + `set_cell_text_by_label`. Regeneration is acceptable as a final fallback when (a) the probe shows the target isn't in an `<hp:tbl>` and (b) the user has been told the original layout will be lost — not as a silent first reflex.
- **HWP 5.0 lossy round-trip**: `.hwp` → `.hwpx` → `.hwp` may drop formatting. Default to `.hwpx` output. Only round-trip back to `.hwp` on explicit user request, and warn first.
- **Misnamed extensions**: a `.hwp` file may actually be HWPX (starts with `PK`). Detect by reading the magic bytes before deciding on workflow.
- **Encoding**: all HWPX XML is UTF-8. Never transcode. Don't escape Korean characters as XML entities — write them as-is.
- **Whitespace preservation**: HWPX uses `xml:space="preserve"` on text runs. When inserting new text via `Edit`, keep the attribute on the parent element or wrapping `<hp:t>` so leading/trailing spaces survive.
- **`.hpf` manifest sync**: when adding/removing files in the unpacked dir, `pack.py` regenerates the manifest. Do not hand-edit `Contents/content.hpf` unless you know the schema.
