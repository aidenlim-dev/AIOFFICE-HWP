# HWP / HWPX Skill

This skill helps Claude work with Korean Hangul Word Processor documents — reading, creating, and editing both the binary `.hwp` (HWP 5.0) and the ZIP-based `.hwpx` formats.

## Quick reference

| Task | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Read text content | `node scripts/extract_text.js <file>` — works for both .hwp and .hwpx |
| Read as markdown (preserves headings/tables) | `node scripts/extract_text.js --format markdown <file>` |
| Inspect structure (pages, sections, tables) | `node scripts/extract_text.js --inspect <file>` |
| Create new document from scratch | `echo '{"path":"out.hwp","operations":[...]}' \| node scripts/create.js` |
| Edit existing `.hwpx` | unpack → edit XML directly with `Edit` tool → pack |
| Edit existing `.hwp` (HWP 5.0 binary) | convert to `.hwpx` via `convert.js` first, then edit-as-hwpx |
| Convert `.hwp` ↔ `.hwpx` | `node scripts/convert.js <input> <output>` |
| Validate output | `python scripts/validate.py <file.hwpx>` |
| Preview file in a preview pane (Code or cowork+`Claude_Preview`) | `preview_start` → `preview_eval` to `http://localhost:3737/?path=...` (see Preview section) |

> Conversion to PDF / DOCX is **out of scope for v0**. Will be added in a later release via LibreOffice headless.

## Format primer

- **`.hwpx`** — ZIP container holding XML. Same archetype as `.docx`. Use the unpack/edit/pack workflow. Internal layout includes `Contents/section0.xml` (body), `Contents/header.xml` (styles, fonts), `Contents/content.hpf` (manifest). See `references/hwpx-format.md`.
- **`.hwp`** — HWP 5.0 binary (CFB/OLE container). NOT a ZIP. Direct XML editing is impossible. For edits, convert to `.hwpx` via `convert.js`. For read-only operations, `extract_text.js` handles binary `.hwp` transparently via the rhwp WASM library.

When in doubt about format, read the first two bytes — `PK` indicates ZIP (treat as HWPX even if extension is `.hwp`).

## Decision tree

### "Read this file" / "Summarize" / "Translate the content"

```bash
node scripts/extract_text.js path/to/file.hwp > /tmp/text.txt
# Then read /tmp/text.txt and respond
```

`extract_text.js` handles both `.hwp` and `.hwpx` via rhwp WASM. Default output is plaintext (one paragraph per line).

For structured content (headings, tables, lists preserved):
```bash
node scripts/extract_text.js --format markdown path/to/file.hwp > /tmp/text.md
```

For metadata only:
```bash
node scripts/extract_text.js --inspect path/to/file.hwp
# Returns JSON: { pageCount, sectionCount, paragraphCount, tableCount, hasImages, ... }
```

### "Create a new document" / "Write this as a hwp file"

`create.js` reads a JSON payload from stdin and writes the file to the path you supply. Output format is decided by the path extension (`.hwp` = HWP 5.0 binary, `.hwpx` = OOXML).

```bash
echo '{
  "path": "report.hwp",
  "operations": [
    {"type": "setup_document", "page_size": "a4", "margin_mm": 25},
    {"type": "append_heading", "level": 1, "text": "월간 보고서"},
    {"type": "append_paragraph", "text": "이번 달 핵심 지표 요약입니다. 주요 변화는 **매출 증가**와 *비용 절감*입니다."},
    {"type": "append_table",
      "headers": ["항목", "지난달", "이번달"],
      "rows": [["매출", "100억", "120억"], ["비용", "80억", "75억"]]
    },
    {"type": "append_image", "path": "/abs/path/chart.png", "width_cm": 12, "height_cm": 6.6}
  ]
}' | node scripts/create.js
```

`stdout` returns one JSON line:

```json
{ "status": "success", "path": "report.hwp", "bytes_written": 14336, "ops_applied": 5,
  "verify": { "pageCountAfter": 1, "recovered": true },
  "log": ["…", "stripped 4 PARA_LINESEG record(s)"] }
```

Errors come back as `{"status": "error", "message": "...", "op_index": N}`. Always read the JSON to confirm — exit code 0 even on op-level failures isn't guaranteed.

**Op vocabulary** (in the order you'd typically use them):

| Op | Required | Optional |
|----|----------|----------|
| `setup_document` | `page_size` (`a4`/`b5`/...), `orientation` (`portrait`/`landscape`) | `margin_mm`, `base_font` |
| `append_heading` | `level` (1–6), `text` | `align`, `runs` |
| `append_paragraph` | `text` | `align`, `line_spacing`, `spacing_before`, `spacing_after`, `runs` |
| `append_table` | `headers`, `rows` | `col_widths_cm`, `merges`, `cell_props` |
| `append_image` | `path` | `width_cm`, `height_cm`, `alt` |
| `append_bullet_list`, `append_numbered_list` | `items[]` | — |
| `append_page_break` | — | — |
| `replace_text` | `query`, `replacement` | `case_sensitive` |

Inline `**bold**` and `*italic*` are parsed automatically inside `text` and table cell strings. `runs:[{text, bold?, italic?, fontSize?, color?}]` overrides the parser when you need finer control.

**Known limitations** (rhwp serializer constraints — applies to anything emitted via this skill):

- **HWPX tables are dropped by rhwp's `exportHwpx()`**. If a doc has tables, write `.hwp` and (if HWPX is required) round-trip through Hancom Office or 한컴독스 to re-emit the table XML. `convert.js` won't help — it goes through the same rhwp serializer.
- **HWP→HWPX downconversion is lossy** (tables, images, complex shapes). Default to `.hwp` for tables; default to `.hwpx` only when the document is text-heavy.

### "Edit this document" / "Replace X with Y" / "Add a new paragraph"

**For `.hwpx` files (recommended path):**

1. Unpack:
   ```bash
   python scripts/unpack.py path/to/file.hwpx /tmp/unpacked/
   ```
2. Edit XML files directly using your `Edit` tool. Key files:
   - `/tmp/unpacked/Contents/section0.xml` — main body content
   - `/tmp/unpacked/Contents/header.xml` — document-level styles, fonts, page settings
   - `/tmp/unpacked/Contents/content.hpf` — manifest
   See `references/hwpx-format.md` for element references and common edit patterns.
3. Repack:
   ```bash
   python scripts/pack.py /tmp/unpacked/ output.hwpx --original path/to/file.hwpx
   ```
4. Validate:
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate.py output.hwpx
   ```

**For `.hwp` (HWP 5.0 binary) files:**

```bash
# 1. Convert to .hwpx via rhwp WASM
node scripts/convert.js input.hwp /tmp/converted.hwpx
# 2. Then proceed with the .hwpx workflow above
```

**Output format default**: save edits as `.hwpx`. The HWPX format is the modern Hangul Office standard and avoids the lossy round-trip back to HWP 5.0 binary. Only convert back to `.hwp` if the user explicitly requires HWP 5.0 output (use `node scripts/convert.js output.hwpx final.hwp` and warn that some formatting may be lost).

### "Show me what this looks like" / "Preview this HWP file"

The skill ships a tiny Node HTTP server (`scripts/preview-server.js`) that serves a vanilla-JS canvas-based viewer; rhwp WASM does the actual rendering in the browser, so the result matches Hancom Office closely. No LibreOffice, no external browser.

**The preview pane is host-agnostic.** Whoever exposes the `preview_start` / `preview_eval` / `preview_stop` tools can drive it. Two known hosts today:

- **Claude Code (CLI)** — built-in. Tool names are bare: `preview_start`, `preview_eval`, `preview_stop`. Requires a one-time `.claude/launch.json` entry (below).
- **claude.ai cowork (web) with the `Claude_Preview` plugin** — same tools, namespaced (`Claude_Preview:preview_start` etc.). The plugin must be installed in the cowork session; it iframes the localhost URL the same way Code's pane does. The user's machine still runs the Node server.

If neither host is present (Claude API direct / headless CI), see **Fallback** at the end of this section.

**Setup once per workspace (Claude Code only)** — `.claude/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "claw-hwp-preview",
      "runtimeExecutable": "node",
      "runtimeArgs": ["<absolute-path-to>/scripts/preview-server.js"],
      "port": 3737
    }
  ]
}
```

If missing, create or merge before calling `preview_start`. On a typical plugin install the path is `~/.claude/plugins/claw-hwp/skills/hwp/scripts/preview-server.js`. Cowork's `Claude_Preview` plugin handles process management itself — no launch.json needed there. Port `3737` is the default; override via `CLAW_HWP_PREVIEW_PORT`.

**The lifecycle — start, navigate, stop.** The viewer is a long-lived page in a long-lived pane. You do NOT spawn a fresh server per file.

1. **`preview_start`** with `name: "claw-hwp-preview"` (or the cowork-namespaced equivalent). Returns either a fresh pane or `reused: true` if one is already open.
2. **`preview_eval`** to set `window.location.href = "http://localhost:3737/?path=<absolute path>"`. Use this both for the first navigation and for swapping to a different file later. Do not start a second server.
3. **`preview_stop`** when you need to recover a stuck pane (see below).

The viewer reads `?path=`, renders every page to its own canvas, and shows a 자동 보정 toggle (calls rhwp's `reflowLinesegs()` — same fix `create.js` applies server-side to strip stale layout caches). Auto-correction defaults ON; the toolbar toggle flips it for raw inspection.

**When to auto-preview — don't ask, just fire.** In every situation below, run `preview_start` → `preview_eval` immediately. Visual verification is your job, not the user's.

1. Right after `create.js` / `convert.js` writes a new file or finishes a format conversion — feed the returned `path` straight into the URL.
2. Right after the user uploads a `.hwp` / `.hwpx` to the workspace or mentions one by path.
3. Right after edits to an existing file (`replace_text`, unpack-edit-pack round-trip).

Never write "please check if the file looks right." Open the viewer and let them see it.

**Recovering a stuck pane (`reused: true` but nothing visible).** Common failure: `preview_start` returns `reused: true` because a prior pane is still registered, but the pane is closed/hidden and your `preview_eval` lands in a void the user can't see. The fix is hard-reset:

1. Call `preview_stop` (with the same `name`).
2. Call `preview_start` again — this returns a fresh pane.
3. Then `preview_eval` to navigate.

Do this whenever the user says "the pane is empty / didn't open / I can't see it" after a successful `preview_start`. Don't ask — just stop-then-start.

**Server lifecycle the agent owns.** As of the auto-shutdown change, `preview-server.js` self-exits ~2 minutes after the last viewer tab closes (heartbeat-based). It may be dead between user requests even if you started it earlier in the session. **Always health-check before any preview action; if dead, start it yourself via Bash — do not ask the user to run anything.**

```bash
# Health check — anything other than 204 means dead.
curl -fsS -o /dev/null http://localhost:3737/__heartbeat || \
  node ~/.claude/plugins/claw-hwp/skills/hwp/scripts/preview-server.js \
    >/tmp/claw-hwp-preview.log 2>&1 &
disown 2>/dev/null || true
# Give it a beat to bind the port before you fire the next request.
sleep 0.5
```

Adjust the script path if the plugin is installed somewhere other than `~/.claude/plugins/claw-hwp/`. After that, proceed with whichever delivery path applies:

- **Claude Code / cowork + `Claude_Preview`**: call `preview_eval` with the URL as before.
- **Cowork standalone (no `Claude_Preview` plugin), Claude API direct, headless CI**: hand the user a markdown link `[열기 — <filename>](http://localhost:3737/?path=<absolute path>)`. Click opens in their OS default browser. Same viewer, only loss is the inline pane.

## Common pitfalls

- **HWP 5.0 lossy round-trip**: `.hwp` → `.hwpx` → `.hwp` may drop formatting. Default to `.hwpx` output. Only round-trip back to `.hwp` on explicit user request, and warn first.
- **Misnamed extensions**: a `.hwp` file may actually be HWPX (starts with `PK`). Detect by reading the magic bytes before deciding on workflow.
- **Encoding**: all HWPX XML is UTF-8. Never transcode. Don't escape Korean characters as XML entities — write them as-is.
- **Whitespace preservation**: HWPX uses `xml:space="preserve"` on text runs. When inserting new text via `Edit`, keep the attribute on the parent element or wrapping `<hp:t>` so leading/trailing spaces survive.
- **`.hpf` manifest sync**: when adding/removing files in the unpacked dir, `pack.py` regenerates the manifest. Do not hand-edit `Contents/content.hpf` unless you know the schema.
